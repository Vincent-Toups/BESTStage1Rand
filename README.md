BEST Trial Stage 1 Randomization
=======================================

This repository holds code (in the form of an R package) to perform
the stage 1 randomization for the BEST trial. Its useful to have this
in the form of a library so that we can use it form simulation.

Much of the stage 2 randomization has overlapping but not identical
code so that has been separated into its own library.
